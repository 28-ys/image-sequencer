ImageBoard
ImageFlow

========

* [ ] figure out UI/functional separation -- ui is in module wrapper?
* [ ] is there a module for generating forms from parameters?
* [ ] commandline runnability?
* [ ] tests - modules headless; unit tests
* [ ] comparisons with diff
* [ ] standardize panel addition with submodule that offers Panel.display(image)

* [ ] make an Infragram module that accepts a math expression
* [ ] click to expand for all images
* [ ] "add a new step" menu

* [ ] allow passing data as data-uri or Image object, or stream, or ndarray or ImageData array, if both of neighboring pair has ability?
* [ ] ...could we directly include package.json for module descriptions? At least as a fallback.

* [ ] BUG: this doesn't work for defaults:  imageboard.loadImage('examples/grid.png', function() {
  * we should make defaults a config of the first module
